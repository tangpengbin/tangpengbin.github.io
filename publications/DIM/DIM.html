            Fig. 1. Discrete Interlocking Materials are governed by strongly coupled, highly anisotropic, and asymmetric deformation limits.
            Our method is able to capture and reproduce these effects for many types of interlocking materials (a). Using native-scale
            simulations as a basis (b), we construct macromechanical deformation limits on bending and stretching (c) which we use to
            develop an efficient macro-scale simulation model (d).

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        We present a method for computational modeling, mechanical characterization,
        and macro-scale simulation of discrete interlocking materials (DIM)---3D-printed
        chainmail fabrics made of quasi-rigid interlocking elements. Unlike conventional
        elastic materials for which deformation and restoring force are directly coupled,
        the mechanics of DIM are governed by contacts between individual elements that
        give rise to anisotropic deformation constraints. To model the mechanical
        behavior of these materials, we propose a computational approach that builds on
        three key components. (a): we explore the space of feasible deformations using
        native-scale simulations at the per-element level. (b): based on this simulation
        data, we introduce the concept of strain-space boundaries to represent deformation
        limits for in- and out-of-plane deformations, and (c): we use the strain-space
        boundaries to drive an efficient macro-scale simulation model based on homogenized
        deformation constraints. We evaluate our method on a set of representative discrete
        interlocking materials and validate our findings against measurements on physical prototypes.
