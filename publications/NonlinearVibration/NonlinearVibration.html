            Fig. 1. Our method enables optimization-driven design of compliant mechanical systems with periodic large-amplitude motions.
            For this pair of dragon wings, the initial design (a, b) exhibits only small oscillation response when driven by
            harmonic forcing at a frequency of 2.5Hz. Our approach automatically finds optimized design parameters (extra masses at the
            trailing edge of the wing) that lead to substantially increased amplitude (c, d).

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        We present a computational method for designing compliant mechanical systems
        that exhibit large-amplitude oscillations. The technical core of our approach
        is an optimization-driven design tool that combines sensitivity analysis for
        optimization with the Harmonic Balance Method for simulation. By establishing
        dynamic force equilibrium in the frequency domain, our formulation avoids the
        major limitations of existing alternatives: it handles nonlinear forces, side-steps
        any transient process, and automatically produces periodic solutions. We introduce
        design objectives for amplitude optimization and trajectory matching that enable
        intuitive high-level authoring of large-amplitude motions. Our method can be applied
        to many types of mechanical systems, which we demonstrate through a set of
        examples involving compliant mechanisms, flexible rod networks, elastic thin
        shell models, and multi-material solids. We further validate our approach by
        manufacturing and evaluating several physical prototypes.
